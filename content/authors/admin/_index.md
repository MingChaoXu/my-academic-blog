I am a master major in computer science at Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences(CASIA), supervised by Prof. Chenglin Liu in my second year of postgraduate. 
<!-- I visited Prof. Jian-Yun Nie’s group at University of Montreal (UdeM) and Dr. Jian Tang’s group at Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) in the past summer. In the past half year, I worked as a research intern in NLC Group at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), mentored by Dr. Dongdong Zhang. I recently join Google Brain Team as a research intern, mentored by Dr. Denny Zhou. -->

<!-- I will apply for a Ph.D. this year. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested. -->
